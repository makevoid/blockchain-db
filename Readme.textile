h1. BlockchainDB

BlockchainDB is a way to store your data securely and permanently on Bitcoin's blockchain using the best tools available at the moment

- Bitcore library - JS, can integrate with anything.
- Bitcoin Core pruned server - fast, light, and the most stable solution available!

It starts with a simple UI tool but the project aims to build a library for every programming language to interface with the blockchain as an append-only database.
